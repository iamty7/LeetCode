	 * Given an integer, write an algorithm to convert it to hexadecimal. For
	 * negative integer, twoâ€™s complement method is used.
	 * 
	 * Note: All letters in hexadecimal (a-f) must be in lowercase. The
	 * hexadecimal string must not contain extra leading 0s. If the number is
	 * zero, it is represented by a single zero character '0'; otherwise, the
	 * first character in the hexadecimal string will not be the zero character.
	 * The given number is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed
	 * integer. You must not use any method provided by the library which
	 * converts/formats the number to hex directly.
	 * 
	 * Example 1: Input: 26 Output: "1a"
	 * 
	 * Example 2: Input: -1 Output: "ffffffff"
